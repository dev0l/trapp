### Trapp — Transcripts Become Programs

**Trapp transforms transcripts, notes, and raw text into clear, structured study programs — instantly and entirely on your device.**

Instead of re-reading walls of text, Trapp helps you move from information to action. Paste a transcript or any block of text, and Trapp generates a focused study program with key points, tasks, and reflective questions.

No accounts.
No cloud processing.
No tracking.

Just structure.

### What Trapp Does

Trapp turns unstructured text into a study program consisting of:

* **Key Points** – distilled concepts and ideas
* **Study Tasks** – concrete actions to deepen understanding
* **Reflective Questions** – prompts to explore meaning and connections

You stay in control at every step. Programs can be regenerated, edited, reordered, or shared when needed.

### Why Trapp

Transcripts are everywhere — lectures, videos, meetings, talks — but they are rarely usable as-is.

Trapp is designed for moments when you want to *work with* information, not just store it.

It supports:

* studying
* learning from videos or talks
* reflecting on written material
* turning passive content into active engagement

“Study” here does not mean formal education only — it means **intentional understanding**.

---

### Privacy & Processing

All processing happens **locally on your device**.

* No uploads
* No servers
* No user accounts
* No analytics or tracking

Your text stays yours.

---

### Platform

Trapp is built as a native iOS app with a focus on clarity, calm interaction, and offline reliability.

---

### Philosophy

Trapp is intentionally simple.

It does not try to think for you.
It helps you **structure your own thinking**.

Transcripts become programs —
and programs become movement.
